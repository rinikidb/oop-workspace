1. What is the purpose of the log message you supply to your git commit?
Ans: The purpose of the log message is to provide a concise and informative summary of the changes made in the commit. 
It helps other developers (and your future self) understand the context and purpose of the changes.

2. What do you think makes a good commit message?
Ans: A good commit message is descriptive, yet succinct, providing enough information to understand the changes without being overly verbose. 
It should start with a brief summary (around 50 characters), followed by a more detailed explanation if necessary, and optionally reference any relevant issues or tickets.

3. When and how often should I be committing my work?
Ans: You should commit your work frequently, ideally after completing a logical unit of work or making significant changes. 
It's generally recommended to commit small, incremental changes rather than large, monolithic ones. This helps in tracking progress, managing changes, and collaborating effectively with others.

4. True or False, you should commit all files (including binaries, images, and log files) to Git.
Ans: False. It's not advisable to commit all files blindly to Git, especially binaries, images, and log files. 
Instead, you should selectively choose files that are necessary for the project (source code, configuration files, documentation) and avoid committing generated files or files that can be easily regenerated. 
This practice keeps the repository clean, reduces its size, and maintains the focus on versioning essential components of your project.
